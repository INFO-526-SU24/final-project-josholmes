This would suggest that economic factors play a significant role in educational attainment.\nAnalysis plan\n\nFor question one - I need to normalize the 19-year-old in Apprenticeships to population as we would expect that towns with a high population would have larger number of 19-year old. To normalize this I will sum all the activity at 19-years and then find the percentage of that number that are in apprenticeships. This will be our Y-axis. Our x-axis will be if their is a university present. Then I will have the regions set colors.\nFor question two - I will created a 3D scatter plot with the following variables. X-axis will be income, Y-axis will be job Density and the Z-axis will be Education score. I will also add color to the education score to add a heat map effect to clearing distinguish where we are seeing high educational scores.\n\nPlan of Attack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Name\nStatus\nDue\nPriority\nSummary\n\n\nDraft Proposal For Peer Reveiw\nComplete\n5/25/2024\nHigh\nSubmit Proposal\n\n\nSubmit Proposal For Peer Review\nComplete\n5/29/2024\nHigh\nSubmit Proposal\n\n\nReview Peer Review Feedback\nIncomplte\n5/29/2004\nHigh\nReview issues for peer reveiw\n\n\nAddress Peer Review Feedbak\nIncomplte\n06/03/2024\nHigh\nMake changes based on peer review\n\n\nSumbit Proposal For Instructer Review\nIncomplte\n06/03/2024\nHigh\nSubmit Proposal with changes from peer review\n\n\nDraft Write-Up\nIncomplte\n06/15/2024\nHigh\nGet a draft down of the write up\n\n\nFinailize Write-UP\nIncomplte\n06/24/2024\nHigh\nFinialize and submit the final write-up\n\n\nDraft Presentation\nIncomplte\n06/15/2024\nHigh\nGet a draft of the presentation\n\n\nFinalize Presentation\nIncomplte\n06/24/2024\nHigh\nFinialize and submit the presentation"

    "text": "Interpreting the Box Plot\n\nLooks like the North East and North West have higher median of 19-year olds in apprenticeships in towns without universities\nThe distributions of 19-year olds in apprenticeship is more spread out in towns with no university and more consolidated in towns with universities\nThe North West contains the town with the highest number fo 19-years old in apprenticeships but they are outliers. The median for the North West is behind the North East\nThe North East does not contain the towns with the highest percentage of 19-year olds in apprenticeships but the region has the highest median of 19 year-olds in apprenticeships for both towns with universities present and towns without universities\nA lot of data clustered together wanted to create a graph that shows the same data but not so congested together"
