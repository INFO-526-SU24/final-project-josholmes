    "text": "Questions\nThe two questions you want to answer.\nFor my first question will be to look at the the relationship between university presence and region on the number of 19-year-old in apprenticeships.\nFor my second question I want to see if there is a relationship between higher income and job density leads to higher education scores. This would suggest that economic factors play a significant role in educational attainment.\nAnalysis plan\n\nFor question one - I need to normalize the 19-year-old in Apprenticeships to population as we would expect that towns with a high population would have larger number of 19-year old. To normalize this I will sum all the activity at 19-years and then find the percentage of that number that are in apprenticeships. This will be our Y-axis. Our x-axis will be if their is a university present. Then I will have the regions set colors.\nFor question two - I will created a 3D scatter plot with the following variables. X-axis will be income, Y-axis will be job Density and the Z-axis will be Education score. I will also add color to the education score to add a heat map effect to clearing distinguish where we are seeing high educational scores."
