This would suggest that economic factors play a significant role in educational attainment. (Just noticed that only one question is required for individual teams, this question will be a backup question)\nAnalysis plan\n\nFor question one - I need to normalize the 19-year-old in Apprenticeships to the population as we would expect that towns with a higher population would have larger numbers of 19-year old. To normalize this I will sum all the activity at 19-years columns and then find the percentage of those in apprenticeships. This will be our Y-axis. Our x-axis will be if their is a university present. Then I will have the regions set colors.\n\n\n#The columns that look at ativity of 19 year olds\nenglish_education |&gt; \n  select(starts_with(\"activity\")) |&gt;\n  names()\n\n[1] \"activity_at_age_19_appprenticeships\"\n\n#Regions that we will be looking at;\nunique(english_education$rgn11nm)\n\n [1] \"East Midlands\"            \"South West\"              \n [3] \"East of England\"          \"Yorkshire and The Humber\"\n [5] \"North West\"               \"West Midlands\"           \n [7] \"South East\"               \"North East\"              \n [9] \"London\"                   NA                        \n\n#data for determine if there is a univierty present to look at if a university is present\nunique(english_education$university_flag)\n\n[1] \"No university\" \"University\"    NA             \n\n\n\nFor question two - I will created a 3D scatter plot with the following variables. X-axis will be income, Y-axis will be job Density and the Z-axis will be Education score. I will also add color to the education score to add a heat map effect to clearing distinguish where we are seeing high educational scores.\n\nPlan of Attack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Name\nStatus\nDue\nPriority\nSummary\n\n\nDraft Proposal For Peer Review\nComplete\n5/25/2024\nHigh\nSubmit Proposal\n\n\nSubmit Proposal For Peer Review\nComplete\n5/29/2024\nHigh\nSubmit Proposal\n\n\nReview Peer Review Feedback\nIComplete\n5/29/2004\nHigh\nReview issues for peer reveiw\n\n\nAddress Peer Review Feedback\nComplete\n06/03/2024\nHigh\nMake changes based on peer review\n\n\nSubmbit Proposal For Instructor Review\nComplete\n06/03/2024\nHigh\nSubmit Proposal with changes from peer review\n\n\nDraft Write-Up\nIncomplete\n06/15/2024\nHigh\nGet a draft down of the write up\n\n\nFinalize Write-UP\nIncomplete\n06/24/2024\nHigh\nFinalize and submit the final write-up\n\n\nDraft Presentation\nIncomplete\n06/15/2024\nHigh\nGet a draft of the presentation\n\n\nFinalize Presentation\nIncomplete\n06/24/2024\nHigh\nFinalize and submit the presentation"

The analysis examines the relationship between university presence and regional differences in the number of 19-year-olds entering apprenticeships, hypothesizing that the absence of a university might lead to higher apprenticeship rates.

    "text": "Introduction\nThis project utilizes the data set from the week of January 23, 2024 on the TidyTuesdayR website. This data set  focuses on the educational attainment of young people in English towns. Provided by the UK Office for National Statistics, this data set explores why children and young people in smaller towns often perform better academically than those in larger towns. The data includes a variety of metrics such as population, regional classifications, coastal status, job density, income levels, university presence, and detailed educational outcomes at various stages, from Key Stage 2 through age 22.\nI chose to use this data set because, upon reviewing it, I immediately envisioned the variety of compelling visuals that could be created from the rich and detailed information it contains. The diverse metrics, ranging from educational outcomes to economic factors, present numerous opportunities for insightful data visualizations.\nFor my analysis with this data set, I will examine the relationship between university presence and regional differences on the number of 19-year-olds in apprenticeships. This question interests me because it combines educational infrastructure with geographic diversity, potentially revealing how the presence of universities and the specific characteristics of different regions influence the career paths young people choose. My initial thought would be that the absent of a university would push more 19-year-olds into apprenticeships due to the pursing university endeavors is an available option."

Therefore, I start with a simple geom_point plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geom_point plot gives me an idea of the data, however, there is to much going on in this visualization. I also suspect that there is a lot of hidden data due to overlap. The next approach will give us an idea of the distribution of the data. This is achieved by creating a box pot visualization of the data using geom_boxplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis give a better representation of the data set. We can see that the median values of 19 year olds in apprenticeships is greater in towns without universities present compared to those town with universities. There is still a lot of data clustered together with this visualization so I use facet_grid to create columns by region and row by the university flag. This visualization makes easier to compare the data between all the interested variables."

The towns with the highest percentage of 19 year olds in apprenticeships is town without university in the North West region. However these town are outliers, the region with the greatest median percentage of 19 year olds in apprenticeships is the North East. Another interesting observation that I noticed was that the spread of the distributions is greater when looking at towns without university and is more consolidated in towns with universities present."
