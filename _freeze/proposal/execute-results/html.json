The dataset contains 1104 rows and 31 columns.\n\nMake sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\nFor my first question will be to look at the the relationship between university presence and region on the number of 19-year-old in apprenticeships.\n\nFor my second question I want to see if there is a relationship between higher income and job density leads to higher education scores. This would suggest that economic factors play a significant role in educational attainment.\n\nAnalysis plan\n\n-   For question one - I need to normalize the 19-year-old in Apprenticeships to population as we would expect that towns with a high population would have larger number of 19-year old. To normalize this I will sum all the activity at 19-years and then find the percentage of that number that are in apprenticeships. This will be our Y-axis. Our x-axis will be if their is a university present. Then I will have the regions set colors.\n\n-   For question two - I will created a 3D scatter plot with the following variables. X-axis will be income, Y-axis will be job Density and the Z-axis will be Education score. I will also add color to the education score to add a heat map effect to clearing distinguish where we are seeing high educational scores.\n\nPlan of Attack\n\n|                                       |           |            |           |                                               |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Task Name                             | Status    | Due        | Priority  | Summary                                       |\n| Draft Proposal For Peer Reveiw        | Complete  | 5/25/2024  | High      | Submit Proposal                               |\n| Submit Proposal For Peer Review       | Complete  | 5/29/2024  | High      | Submit Proposal                               |\n| Review Peer Review Feedback           | Incomplte | 5/29/2004  | High      | Review issues for peer reveiw                 |\n| Address Peer Review Feedbak           | Incomplte | 06/03/2024 | High      | Make changes based on peer review             |\n| Sumbit Proposal For Instructer Review | Incomplte | 06/03/2024 | High      | Submit Proposal with changes from peer review |\n| Draft Write-Up                        | Incomplte | 06/15/2024 | High      | Get a draft down of the write up              |\n| Finailize Write-UP                    | Incomplte | 06/24/2024 | High      | Finialize and submit the final write-up       |\n| Draft Presentation                    | Incomplte | 06/15/2024 | High      | Get a draft of the presentation               |\n| Finalize Presentation                 | Incomplte | 06/24/2024 | High      | Finialize and submit the presentation         |\n",
