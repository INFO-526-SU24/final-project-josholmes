We can see the dimensions of the the data below as well as the name of the columns by running the below code.\n\nenglish_education <- english_education |> select(activity_at_age_19_appprenticeships, rgn11nm, university_flag)\nwrite.csv(english_education, file = \"data/edudata.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.\n\nThe data set contains columns related to towns, town codes, town names, population, regional information, coastal classification, job density, income, university presence, and education attainment statistics. The dataset contains 1104 rows and 31 columns.\n\nMake sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\nFor my first question will be to look at the the relationship between university presence and region on the number of 19-year-old in apprenticeships.\n\nFor my second question I want to see if there is a relationship between higher income and job density leads to higher education scores. This would suggest that economic factors play a significant role in educational attainment. (Just noticed that only one question is required for individual teams, this question will be a backup question)\n\nAnalysis plan\n\n-   For question one - I need to normalize the 19-year-old in Apprenticeships to the population as we would expect that towns with a higher population would have larger numbers of 19-year old. To normalize this I will sum all the activity at 19-years columns and then find the percentage of those in apprenticeships. This will be our Y-axis. Our x-axis will be if their is a university present. Then I will have the regions set colors.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#The columns that look at ativity of 19 year olds\nenglish_education |> \n  select(starts_with(\"activity\")) |>\n  names()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"activity_at_age_19_appprenticeships\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Regions that we will be looking at;\nunique(english_education$rgn11nm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"East Midlands\"            \"South West\"              \n [3] \"East of England\"          \"Yorkshire and The Humber\"\n [5] \"North West\"               \"West Midlands\"           \n [7] \"South East\"               \"North East\"              \n [9] \"London\"                   NA                        \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#data for determine if there is a univierty present to look at if a university is present\nunique(english_education$university_flag)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"No university\" \"University\"    NA             \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   For question two - I will created a 3D scatter plot with the following variables. X-axis will be income, Y-axis will be job Density and the Z-axis will be Education score. I will also add color to the education score to add a heat map effect to clearing distinguish where we are seeing high educational scores.\n\nPlan of Attack\n\n|                                        |            |            |          |                                               |\n|-----------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Task Name                              | Status     | Due        | Priority | Summary                                       |\n| Draft Proposal For Peer Review         | Complete   | 5/25/2024  | High     | Submit Proposal                               |\n| Submit Proposal For Peer Review        | Complete   | 5/29/2024  | High     | Submit Proposal                               |\n| Review Peer Review Feedback            | IComplete  | 5/29/2004  | High     | Review issues for peer reveiw                 |\n| Address Peer Review Feedback           | Complete   | 06/03/2024 | High     | Make changes based on peer review             |\n| Submbit Proposal For Instructor Review | Complete   | 06/03/2024 | High     | Submit Proposal with changes from peer review |\n| Draft Write-Up                         | Incomplete | 06/15/2024 | High     | Get a draft down of the write up              |\n| Finalize Write-UP                      | Incomplete | 06/24/2024 | High     | Finalize and submit the final write-up        |\n| Draft Presentation                     | Incomplete | 06/15/2024 | High     | Get a draft of the presentation               |\n| Finalize Presentation                  | Incomplete | 06/24/2024 | High     | Finalize and submit the presentation          |\n",
