The variables I will use for this will be. The town names, size flags, university present, I will create a column that will look at all the activity at 19 columns and find the percentage that falls into the apprenticeship category.\n\nFor my second question I will look to see if we can find a relationship between costal/non costal cities and their population with if there is a universtiy present in those cities. I will do this with town names, costal detailed, and unveristy present.\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n",
